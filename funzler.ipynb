    "## What is Funzler\n",
    "Funzler has a knowledge base about which scenarios can cause which critical events. Given some observed critical events in the input, it tries to infer some explanations from the knowledge base. The goal is to identify data parts in which no explanations at all can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "High level overview\n",
    "<img src=\"./csa/img/overview.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "How does a knowledge model / base look like? For instance, in a traffic light detection context, it could look like this\n",
    "<img src=\"./csa/img/example.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on these terms here...\n",
    "- **Events**\n",
    "  - m_1: Red traffic light for ego lane is not detected\n",
    "  - m_2: Ego vehicle detects traffic light (for ego lane) or something very near to it but\n",
    "recognizes green / yellow state\n",
    "- **Use Case** UC_1: Handle traffic light intersections while driving in lane (the only one in this example)\n",
    "- **Boundary**: Scenarios which could cause some critical events <br>\n",
    "- **Relation**: {impossible, almost impossible, unlikely, unknown, likely, almost certain, certain}\n",
    "\n",
    "We just skip the yellow and blue blocks. They are not important here.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the input look like?\n",
    "- Input is an observation of critical events, which is to be diagnosed.\n",
    "- E.g. [-1 1] means m_1 is absent, m_2 is present (red TL for ego is detected, but also a green / yellow TL is detected near it).\n",
    "- E.g. [1 0] means m_1 is present, m_2 is unknown (e.g. unobserved, not related)\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the output look like? Three possible labels...\n",
    "- **fail pending**: Funzler can find some potential explanations, but the boundaries in the explanation are happening or not? No idea.\n",
    "- **fail known**: Funzler can find some plausible explanations from knowledge base.\n",
    "- **fail unknown**: Funzler can't find any plausible explanations from knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a scenario-mining tester, the more fail unknowns, the more interesting scenarios could be discovered!\n",
    "\n",
    "So... assume we have no data at all about \"whether boundaries are happening or not\", we get only fail unknown / fail pending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait... if you get a fail pending, what if you encourage yourself to watch these frames and annotate whether the boundaries are occurring or not? Then it's possible to update the input and iterate the diagnosis towards fail known / fail unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run an example."
